# StaticPageGenerator
My custom static page generator - not meant to be generic

There are currently two main functionalities:
Menu generation: takes two files
- Menu Entries
- Affected pages

Template: takes three arguments
- Detailed contents
- Template file
- Target file

Currently it processes one file at a time.
